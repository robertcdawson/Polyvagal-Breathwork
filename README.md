# Polyvagal Breathwork App
A simple, clean, and interactive web-based application to guide your breathwork practice, based on principles of Polyvagal Theory. This tool helps you use your breath to calm your nervous system with guided animations, presets for established techniques, and customizable timers.

# Features
- Intuitive Visual Guide: A central circle fills and empties in sync with the breath cycle, providing a clear, intuitive visual pacer.

- Science-Backed Presets: Includes one-click presets for evidence-based techniques:

  - Extended Exhale Breathing

  - Box Breathing

  - Resonance Frequency Breathing

  - VOO (Humming) Breathing

- Smart Duration: Each preset automatically sets the session to its research-backed minimum effective duration.

- Fully Customizable: Manually adjust the duration (in seconds) for each phase of the breath cycle (Inhale, Hold In, Exhale, Hold Out).

- Session Timer: Set a total duration for your practice, and the app will run until the time is complete.

- Clean & Calming UI: A minimalist, mobile-friendly design with a soothing color palette and background helps you focus on your practice without distraction.

  - Press "Start" to begin the guided session.

# Breathwork Techniques Included 
- Extended Exhale: The foundational polyvagal technique to promote calm by making the exhale longer than the inhale, which helps activate the parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) nervous system.

- Box Breathing: A classic technique for reducing stress and improving focus by making all phases of the breath cycle (inhale, hold, exhale, hold) equal in duration.

- Resonance Breathing: A method to maximize heart rate variability (HRV) by syncing your breath to a specific, calming rhythm (typically around 5.5-6 breaths per minute).

- VOO Breath: This technique uses an extended exhale combined with humming a deep "VOO" sound. The gentle vibration created by the hum directly stimulates the vagus nerve, deepening the relaxation response.
